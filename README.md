# LearnTube 📚

Let me introduce you to **LearnTube** - because who said learning can't be as addictive as your regular YouTube scroll?

## **What's This All About?**

Think YouTube, but make it *smart*. LearnTube is your pocket-sized education companion that curates educational content from trusted channels. No more falling down random rabbit holes of cat videos (though they're adorable) when you're supposed to be learning about quantum physics!

## **The Cool Stuff**

- 🎓 **Curated Educational Content**: Focused on three main categories:
  - Education (featuring channels like CrashCourse and MIT OpenCourseWare)
  - News (keeping you informed with CNN and Bloomberg)
  - Science & Tech (mind-bending content from Veritasium and SciShow)
  
- 🎯 **Smart Filtering**: Only shows content from trusted educational channels
- 📱 **Clean Interface**: Because learning shouldn't be complicated
- 🎬 **Shorts Support**: For when you need quick knowledge bites

## **Try It Yourself!**

The app is live and ready for you to explore at:
